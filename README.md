# Notion-like Project

This repository contains the source code for a Notion-like app designed to demonstrate modern web development practices using React, TypeScript, and the use-immer library. The project focuses on advanced frontend techniques and state management, ideal for developers looking to deepen their understanding of these areas.

## Features

- **Dynamic Content Management:** Enables users to create, update, and delete notes or documents.
- **Async Data Handling:** Manages asynchronous API interactions for fetching and posting data.

## Technologies Used

- **React Hooks:** Implements modern React features like useState, useEffect, useRef, and custom hooks for managing state and side effects.
- **TypeScript:** Enhances code quality and maintainability through static type checking.
- **use-immer:** Facilitates working with immutable state in React applications in a more intuitive manner.

## Concepts Explained

### React Hooks

- **useState:** Allows adding and managing local state within functional components.
- **useEffect:** Manages side effects in functional components, such as API calls, subscriptions, or manual DOM manipulations.
- **useRef:** Provides a way to access DOM nodes or store mutable values across renders.

### TypeScript in React

- **TypeScript Basics:** TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language. It helps in preventing many common bugs that developers might run into when using JavaScript alone.
- **Types and Interfaces:** Used to define the shape of objects, function parameters, and return types, enhancing predictability and reliability of code.

### use-immer

- **use-immer:** A hook that allows you to work with immutable state by writing seemingly mutable code, which is then translated into immutable updates behind the scenes.
